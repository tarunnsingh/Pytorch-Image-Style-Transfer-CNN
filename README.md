# Pytorch-Image-Style-Transfer-CNN
### Summary
The project uses Pytorch and [VGG19](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/models/vgg.py) model to tranfer styles from one image (style image) onto another image (content image). Here the VGG19 model is pretrained. 5 stacks of convolution layers are used out of which the first layer is used for style purpose and the second layer from the 4th stack is used for content representation.
